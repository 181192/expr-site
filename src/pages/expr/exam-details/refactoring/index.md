## Reading List

As per [Reading List](https://hvl.instructure.com/courses/3040/pages/reading-list-refactoring) on Refactoring. Remember to look at the work on refactoring C/C++.

## Exam Question

There will only be time for 2-3 questions per module. We will discuss a randomly selected refactoring first. After that, we will discuss a secondary topic (on smells or metrics), but depending on the refactoring we discuss in the first part, we may go seamlessly from one topic to the next.

### Some possible questions/question-styles

- which refactoring should we apply here? why?
- which refactoring has been applied here (source code before/after)?
- make a small example on paper/the whiteboard that shows what refactoring X does
- what are smells/the different smells?
  different metrics, advantages/disadvantages
